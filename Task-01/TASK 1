The code represents output when the header file <iostream.h> is used instead of <iostream>

The output gives out error as no such file or directory, this is because "iostream.h" is deprecated and not astandard header. 
It was used in older programs before C++ was standardized, Functions like cout were defined inside iostream.h

After C++ got standardized, all these functions like cout got moved into the std namespace.
